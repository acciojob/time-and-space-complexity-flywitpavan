    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a way to express the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the input size. Understanding time complexity helps in designing efficient algorithms that can perform well under varying conditions.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm with a linear space complexity can be represented as O(n), which means the space required grows linearly with the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is an important consideration in optimizing algorithms.</p>
